React Documentation Summary

1. Introduction
- React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs)[2][3][5][6].
- It enables developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to changing data, without reloading the page[2][3][4][6].

2. Core Concepts

**a. Component-Based Architecture**
- React applications are built using components—self-contained, reusable building blocks that manage their own logic and UI[1][2][3][4][6].
- Components can be nested, managed, and reused throughout the application, promoting modular and maintainable code[1][3][6].

**b. Declarative UI**
- React allows developers to describe what the UI should look like for any given state, and React updates the DOM to match that state automatically[2][3][4].
- This approach makes the code more predictable and easier to debug[4].

**c. Virtual DOM**
- React uses a Virtual DOM, an in-memory representation of the real DOM. When state changes, React updates only the necessary parts of the DOM, improving performance[3][4][6].

**d. Unidirectional Data Flow**
- Data in React flows in one direction, from parent to child components via props, making data management and debugging simpler[3][6].

**e. JSX (JavaScript XML)**
- JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making component structure and logic more readable and expressive[4][6].
- JSX is compiled to JavaScript before execution.

3. Types of Components

**a. Functional Components**
- These are JavaScript functions that return JSX elements. They are typically used for presentational or stateless components[1][3].
function Welcome(props) {
return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

text

**b. Class Components**
- These are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and must implement a `render()` method. They can manage their own state and lifecycle methods[3][4].
class Welcome extends React.Component {
render() {
return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
}
}

4. State and Props

- **Props:** Short for "properties," props are read-only data passed from parent to child components to customize behavior or appearance[3][4].
- **State:** State is mutable data managed within a component. When state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the new data[4].

5. Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)

- React class components have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` for running code at specific points in a component's life[4].
- Functional components can use the `useEffect` hook to achieve similar effects.

6. Hooks (Functional Components)

- Hooks are special functions (like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) that let you use state and other React features in functional components, introduced in React 16.8[2][3][6].
import { useState } from 'react';
function Counter() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}

7. Event Handling

- React uses camelCase for event handlers (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`), and you pass a function as the event handler[4].
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

text

8. Conditional Rendering

- Components can render different UI based on conditions using JavaScript expressions inside JSX.
{isLoggedIn ? <LogoutButton /> : <LoginButton />}

text

9. Lists and Keys

- Render lists using JavaScript's `map()` function, and provide a unique `key` prop to each list item for efficient updates.
const listItems = items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);

text

10. Routing

- React itself doesn’t provide routing, but libraries like React Router enable client-side navigation between views in SPAs[5].
import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

text

11. State Management

- For complex applications, state management libraries like Redux, MobX, or React’s built-in Context API can be used to manage global state[5][6].

12. Ecosystem and Frameworks

- **Next.js:** Adds server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing for React apps—ideal for SEO and performance[5].
- **Gatsby:** Static site generator optimized for speed, using GraphQL for data[5].
- **Remix, RedwoodJS, Expo, Blitz.js:** Other frameworks that extend React for full-stack, mobile, or rapid development[5].
- **React Native:** Enables building native mobile apps using React components[4][5][6].

13. Best Practices

- Use small, reusable components.
- Keep state as local as possible.
- Use prop-types or TypeScript for prop validation.
- Organize code using folders for components, hooks, and utilities.
- Write unit and integration tests for components.

14. When to Use React

- Ideal for dynamic, interactive UIs, SPAs, and projects requiring reusable components.
- Can be integrated into existing projects incrementally.
- May be overkill for very simple or static websites[6].
