It is a lightweight and flexible framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily.\n\n**How to set up Flask?**\n\nTo set up Flask, you need to install it using pip, the Python package manager. Here's an example:\n\n```\npip install flask\n```\n\n**Writing Flask Code**\n\nHere's a simple \"Hello World\" example to get you started:\n\n```\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    return 'Hello, World!'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nThis code creates a new Flask application, defines a route for the root URL ('/'), and returns the string \"Hello, World!\" when that route is accessed. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is used to ensure that the application only runs if it's being executed directly (i.e., not being imported as a module by another script).\n\n**References**\n\n* [Flask Documentation: Testing Flask Applications](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/testing/)\n* [Flask Documentation: Version 0.10](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/0.10.x/)\n\nNote: The provided documentation context does not contain sufficient information on setting up Flask or writing Flask code.
